title: hi, i'm rohan

welcome to my corner of the internet!

#### who i am
i'm a robotics engineer who's currently building [hd maps](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/research-and-development/mapping/) to power self-driving cars at [uber atg](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/).

before that, i researched autonomous robots at the [university of virginia](https://virginia.edu), and taught an undergrad [class](https://cs1501.rohanraval.com) on it.


#### what i'm interested in
the world around us is unstructured, abstruse and complex. i'm interested in developing technology to understand it better, and make it useful for helping us get around more efficiently and safely.

we also consume [gigabytes]((https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/technology/10data.html) of information on a daily basis, in an unstructured and impermanent way. i'm interested in creating systems that can make this knowledge functional, and help us generate and evolve original ideas.

#### why you should care

i write about robotics, tech, software, meta-learning, and various other things -- you can follow along on the [blog](/blog).
