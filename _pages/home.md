:wave: welcome to my corner of the internet!


## who i am
:man_technologist: i'm a robotics engineer who's currently building [hd maps](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/research-and-development/mapping/) to power self-driving cars at [uber atg](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/).

:classical_building: before that, i researched autonomous robots at the [university of virginia](https://virginia.edu), and taught an undergrad [class](https://cs1501.rohanraval.com) on it.

## what i'm interested in
:world_map: the world around us is unstructured and complex. i'm interested in developing technology to understand it better, and make it useful for helping us get around safely and efficiently.

:book: we also consume [tens of gigabytes](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/technology/10data.html) of information on a daily basis in an ad-hoc and impermanent way. i'm interested in creating systems that can make this knowledge functional, and help us methodically generate original ideas.

## why you should care
:memo: i write about robotics, tech, software, meta-learning, and other fun stuff -- you can follow along on the [blog](/blog).
