# Rohan's World

### Purpose
This repository hosts my personal website.
I've decided to develop this solely with the intention to own a small corner of the internet, where I can park some thoughts, writings, and other general content that mostly lives in my head, or my notes app.

This website is __not__ intended as a showcase for some elaborate portfolio or self-promotion venture.

### Tech
This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (a static site generator) with Michael Rose's [Minimal Mistakes Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) (which I have forked this repo from), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 
This is the most simplistic setup I could find to get a site up quickly, cheaply, and most importantly, without getting distracted by the complex beast of building a website. Again, it's focus is solely to publish content, not show off my web dev skillz (of which I have little).

### Structure
Posts live under `_posts`.
Pages live under `_pages`.
Everything else is irrelevant.

### Misc
